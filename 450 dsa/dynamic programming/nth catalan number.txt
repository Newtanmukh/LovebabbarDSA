Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.
